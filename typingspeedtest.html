 `Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum`,

 `Today, historians relate that, as a general rule, buying and selling securities was very much unorganized before the year 1792. Every person who owned a security faced the problem of finding interested buyers who might consider the purchase of a debt-free investment. This meant most people were somewhat slow in investing in stocks and bonds because these securities could not readily be converted into money. We have been told that an interesting number of traders and merchants agreed to try to do something to help correct the situation. At this first crucial meeting, they decided that it was a good idea to visit regularly on a daily basis to buy and sell securities. The group of leaders, whose meeting place was under an old, tall cottonwood tree, found the needed time to plot the financial future of our nation. We know from reading the old records that the original team who met together long ago in May became the very first members of the New York Stock Exchange. The New York Stock Exchange is still operating. Other stock exchanges conduct business in many countries around the world. Thousands and thousands of stocks and bonds are bought and sold each day.`,
